      6 Degrees Of Separation
    </h1> 

    <p> 
      This is a project which visualises the social connections of developers in a GitHub repo <br>
      and checks if the idea of "Six degrees of separation" applies to developers.
      <br> <br>
      <b>Six degrees of separation</b> - is the idea that all people are six, or fewer, social connections away from each other. <br>
      As a result, a chain of "a friend of a friend" statements can be made to connect any two people in a maximum of six steps.
      <br> <br>
      Please enter the address of a GitHub repository into the field below to see a graph of all the connections
      of its developers. <br>
      Example input: nating/cs-exams
